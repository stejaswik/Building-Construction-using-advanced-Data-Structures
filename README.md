Keep track of Buildings under construction in a city using data structures like - Min Heap and Red Black Tree. <br />
"Problem_Statement.pdf" - Consists of the problem statement <br />
"Function_Prototype.pdf" - Describes the functions defined and data structures implemented to solve the Building Construction problem <br />

Step 1: Go to the directory path and "make" <br />
\path\to\dir>make <br />
javac risingCity.java <br />
<br />
Step 2: Give an input file containing information, "Sample_input1.txt" and "Sample_input2.txt" are provided for testing <br />
\path\to\dir>java risingCity Sample_input1.txt <br />

Step 3: After the above command is given, an "output_file.txt" is generated and it should match the "Sample_output1" or "Sample_output2"  <br />
for respective input files.<br />
